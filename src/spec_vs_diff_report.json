  "summary": "The diff only updates `project_state.json` metadata and does not implement the requested backend change to allowlist the specified Principal as an admin. No backend Motoko code or upgrade/stable-state logic is present in the changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the backend admin allowlist so that Principal `vtyfq-kcl6h-mvrxs-ixdx3-ew454-lywvd-3om5o-z3adc-gankr-lwzz2-jae` is recognized as an admin by the canister (i.e., `AccessControl.isAdmin(accessControlState, caller)` returns true for that Principal) and can access all existing admin-only methods; ensure the change persists after redeploy/upgrade.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to the backend Motoko actor (`backend/main.mo`) or any access control/stable state/upgrade logic. The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which is not part of the running canister logic.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced/flagged a production URL loading issue in known issues and set `isFixRequest: true`.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states the production URL loading issue is out of scope unless directly required; the diff adds this issue to metadata and marks the item as a fix request without implementing the admin allowlist change.",
