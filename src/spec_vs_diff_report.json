  "summary": "REQ-24 is implemented by adding a new PrincipalReveal component and rendering it on the /app/profile page. The control can reveal the authenticated user’s Principal ID, shows an unauthenticated message when no identity exists, and includes a copy-to-clipboard button with confirmation. However, the Profile page changes include additional UI/layout redesign that was not explicitly requested and may violate the “keep change minimal and localized” constraint.",

    {
      "description": "Profile page received broader UI/layout changes (new header section, multiple GlassCard sections, additional iconography/styling) beyond simply adding a “Show my Principal” control.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest asked to keep the change minimal and localized, preferably just adding the control to the existing Profile page; the diff shows a more extensive Profile page rework not explicitly requested.",
